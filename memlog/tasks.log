## Notes & Decisions

**2025-06-12 15:50**: 
- Successfully pushed to GitHub repository: https://github.com/asjonDalipaj/music-regulator.git
- All 12 files (2,510 lines) now available on GitHub
- Repository is set up with main branch tracking origin/main
- Project is now version-controlled and publicly accessible

**2025-06-12 15:45**: 
- Git repository initialized successfully
- Initial commit created (2585381) with all project files
- .gitignore configured to exclude node_modules, build files, IDE files, and env files

**2025-06-12 14:30**: 
- Completed Phase 1 foundation with modular TypeScript architecture
- All files under 400-line limit ✅
- Clean dependency graph with no circular dependencies
- Evidence-based therapeutic algorithms implemented
- Ready to proceed with AI/ML simulation layer

**Architecture Decision**:
- Data → Simulation → Music/AI → Components → Portfolio (one-way flow)
- TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support
- Named exports for tree-shaking optimization
- Observer pattern for real-time biofeedback updates

**Next Steps**:
1. Create GitHub repository and push code
2. Complete AI/ML simulation layer (PlaylistRecommender, etc.)
3. Initialize Next.js portfolio project
4. Refactor index.html into React components
5. Integrate and test full system
